    <p>Here is an article I have written about the several continuous distributions that we learnt in high-school, namely the normal distribution, t-distribution and chi-squared distributions.</p>
<p>These are all bell-shaped curves, and therefore it is meaningless to define a normal distribution as a <em>bell-shaped distribution</em> without further discription. In the article, I will explain in-depth the meaning of randomness and give proofs and results about the properties of these distributions, and what makes them differ from each other.</p>
<p>Most importantly, I will be deriving the curve equations (called the <em>pdf</em>) for each of these distributions.</p>
